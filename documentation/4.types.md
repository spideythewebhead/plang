Plang includes few basic types.

1. `Object` is the base type that all the other types inherit from.
1. `Void` declares a type that is used as a function's return type.
1. `Number` declares the base for all the numbers.
1. `Int` declares the type for all integer values. Values: 0, 1, 2, -1
1. `Double` declares the type for all floating values. Values: 0.0, 1.0, 3.14, -1.0.
1. `Bool` declares the type for boolean (truthy) values. Constants: true, false.
1. `String` declares the type for alphanumeric values.
   Strings can use one of the following annotations to create a variable.
   `this is a string` - backticks, 'this is a string' - single quotes, "this is a string" - double quotes
1. `List` (or known as array) declares a type that contains generic values in a row.
1. `Map` (or dictionary) declares a type that contains values of pairs.

Besides these types, you can create your own types.

Types can be created using the `class` keyword.

Example:

```
// Cat is the new type name
class Cat {
    val name: String;

    // This is a constructor to initialize your custom type
    Cat(name: String) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

Create a variable with the new type

```
val myCat: Cat = Cat(`Richard`);
```
