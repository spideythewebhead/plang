To execute code conditionally Plang provides the `if` statement.

If statements expect boolean (true/false) values as their condition.

All values that don't have a boolean type when used in conditions they are evaluated as false.

Comparison operators:

1. \>

   e.g. `a > b`, is a greater than b

1. \>=

   e.g. `a >= b`, is a greater or equal to b

1. <

   e.g. `a < b`, is a less than b

1. <=

   e.g. `a <= b`, is a less or equal to b

1. ==

   e.g. `a == b`, is a equal to b

Conditional operators:

1. and

   e.g. `a == 5 and b < 5`, is a equal to 5 and b less than 5

1. or

   e.g. `a == 5 or b < 5`, is a equal to 5 or b less than 5

Note: `and` has higher priority than `or`. For this expression `a == 1 and b == 2 or c == 3`. This will be evaluated as `(a == 1 and b == 2) or c == 3`.

```
val age: Int = 28;

if (age >= 18) {
    println(`Adult.`);
}
```

In case that you want to execute code when the condition is false then you can you an else branch.

```
val age: Int = 28;

if (age >= 18) {
    println(`Adult`);
} else {
    println(`You are not adult yet.`);
}
```

Lastly, you can join multiple if and else statements.

```
val age: Int = 28;

if (age >= 18) {
    println(`Adult.`);
} else if (age <= 0) {
    println(`Your are not born yet.`);
}else {
    println(`You are not adult yet.`);
}
```
