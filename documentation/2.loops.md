To execute code repeatedly `for` loop statements can be used.

A for loop consists of 4 parts.

1. Initializer, where you can declared an increment variable.
1. Condition, which is checked before is run.
1. Increment, which allows to increment the increment variable.
1. Block of statements.

```
for (var i: Int = 0; i < 10; i += 1) {
    println(`is is : ` + i);
}
```
