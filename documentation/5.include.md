You can break your code into different files and include those in different files.

You can do that by using the `include` directive.

```
include `core.plang`;
```

This includes the core types and functions for `Plang`.

Creating your own files.

```
// a.plang

fn min(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    if (a <= b) {
        return a;
    }
    return b;
}
```

```
// b.plang

include `a.plang`;

println(min(11, 33));
```
